# Active Development Context

This document outlines the current development status and focus of the project.

## Current Status

The project has a well-defined architecture and a solid foundation. The core frontend and backend structures are in place. Key user workflows such as authentication, channel management, and the initial steps of video creation are represented by existing components and Supabase functions.

## Development Focus

The primary focus of development appears to be the build-out and refinement of the end-to-end video creation and scheduling pipeline. While many components exist, the detailed logic connecting them and handling all edge cases is likely the main area of ongoing work.

## Next Steps

Future tasks will likely involve:
-   Implementing the detailed UI logic within the various forms and management components.
-   Building out the error handling and loading states for all asynchronous operations.
-   Refining the Supabase function orchestration to be more robust.
-   Connecting the scheduling components to the backend to enable content publishing.
-   Thoroughly testing the end-to-end video creation flow.
