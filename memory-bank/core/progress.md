# Implementation Progress

This document provides a high-level overview of the implementation status of the application's main features.

## Feature Status

| Feature                       | Status                | Notes                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Authentication**       | Mostly Implemented    | Core login/signup flow is in place. Social auth connections may need further work.                |
| **Billing & Payments**        | Partially Implemented | Backend functions for checkout exist. UI for management is present. End-to-end flow needs testing.  |
| **Channel Management**        | Partially Implemented | UI components for creation and management exist. Backend logic seems to be in place.              |
| **Video Creation UI**         | Mostly Implemented    | Components for selecting topics, styles, and voices are present.                                  |
| **Video Generation Backend**  | Partially Implemented | Supabase functions and service integrations are set up. Robust orchestration and error handling needed. |
| **Content Scheduling**        | Scaffolding Only      | Calendar UI exists, but the logic to connect it to the backend for publishing is likely missing.    |
| **Overall UI/UX**             | Good Foundation       | A consistent UI system is in place with shadcn/ui.                                                |

## Summary

The foundational elements of the application are well-established. The most significant remaining work lies in connecting the various UI components to the backend logic and thoroughly testing the complex, multi-step workflows, especially the video generation and content scheduling pipelines.
